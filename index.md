## About

I am a PhD researcher in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at UCLA, where I study physical oceanography and geophysical fluid dynamics with a focus on ice–ocean interactions in Antarctica.

My work combines numerical modeling, theory, and physical concepts to understand complex systems that are not fully resolved in regional and climate models. In particular, I study submesoscale processes beneath Antarctic ice shelves that may play an important and overlooked role in ice–ocean coupling.

I enjoy problems that involve messy data, deep theory, and real-world constraints, and I care deeply about scientific communication and thoughtful collaboration.
